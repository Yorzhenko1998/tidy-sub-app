# PWA Icons Required

This PWA requires two icon files:

1. **icon-192x192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512x512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons from the provided `icon.svg` file using any image editor or online tool:

1. Open `icon.svg` in an image editor
2. Export as PNG at 192x192 and 512x512 sizes
3. Save as `icon-192x192.png` and `icon-512x512.png` in the `public/` folder

Alternatively, you can use online tools like:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

The icons should have:
- Transparent or solid background
- High contrast for visibility
- Simple, recognizable design

For now, the app will work without these icons, but they are required for a complete PWA experience and proper installation prompts.
